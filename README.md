This is a game + [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) environment that can be trained to teach the mean character survive multiple enemies.

## Setup
Built with Unity 2019.2 and Visual Studio 2017

Clone the repo making sure LFS is enabled (should be by default in the newer Git clients)

## Deep Reinforcement Learning Environment  

Just build the `MainScene` in Unity for DRL experiments.

`drl\PPO\driver.py` - to train
`drl\PPO\eval.py` - to evaluate.

## Model Weights
